# ObscuraCrypt
Project Overview: 
ObscuraCrypt is an innovative project aimed at enhancing the security of sensitive personal identification documents during digital transmission. Developed as part of the Bachelor of Technology curriculum in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Cyber Security, this project combines advanced techniques in cryptography, computer vision, and machine learning to safeguard Aadhar cards, PAN cards, and driving licenses from unauthorized access and data interception.

Key Features:

1. Encryption:
   Implements state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques (AES and RSA) to encrypt sensitive information, ensuring that data remains secure and indecipherable during transmission.
2. Computer Vision-Based Obfuscation:
   Utilizes computer vision techniques to obscure visual representations of sensitive information, preventing unauthorized visual capture.
3. Adaptive Security:
   Integrates machine learning models to dynamically adapt to evolving security threats, providing a proactive defense mechanism.
4. Multi-Layered Protection:
   Combines encryption with visual obfuscation for a robust, multi-layered security approach.
5.Real-Time Processing:
  Future scope includes real-time credential detection and blurring for video streams, enhancing security in dynamic environments such as video conferencing.

Impact: 
ObscuraCrypt sets new standards for secure digital interactions, addressing contemporary challenges in data privacy and contributing significantly to the discourse on safeguarding sensitive information in an increasingly interconnected world.
